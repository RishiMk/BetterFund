# BetterFund
BetterFund is a social-welfare-oriented crowdfunding platform that enables individuals to raise or donate funds for genuine causes related to health, education, emergencies, and community support. The system is divided into three modules: Donor, Campaign Creator, and Admin. Donors can explore campaigns, contribute securely, and track their donation history. Campaign creators can start and manage campaigns, upload media, and monitor progress through a user-friendly dashboard. The Admin module handles campaign approvals, monitors user activity, manages categories, and generates platform-wide reports. BetterFund emphasizes usability, data accuracy, and transparency through well-defined validation mechanisms. The platform fosters trust between donors and campaigners while ensuring responsible oversight to avoid misuse. By offering an inclusive and structured environment, BetterFund promotes meaningful social engagement and provides a secure medium to support authentic, verified, and impactful fundraising efforts.
